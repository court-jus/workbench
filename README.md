# Workbench

A collection of tools I like to have when establishing my workstation. I used to keep those in my dotfiles repository
but they deserve a better home.

## [Media manipulation tools](media/README.md)

* `screenshot.sh`, to capture screenshots and apply actions on them
* `screencast.sh`, a tool to capture screencasts
